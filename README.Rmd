# phenometrics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is designed to calculate, summarize, and plot Time of Emergence (ToE)-based metrics describing and contextualizing how species' phenologies respond to climate change. It contains tools to detect the point at which a species' phenology emerges from its original state to establish a new regime, both in terms of the time at which its phenology occurs, as well as the environmental conditions under which it occurs. It also contains tools to detect the timing of ecological mismatch, and functions to summarize multi-species results into community-wide indicators to analyze the effects of climate change on community phenology as a whole.

## Installation

You can install the development version of phenometrics from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("reidsteele2/phenometrics")
```

## Example

Unlike standard phenological analyses, which tend to focus on rates of change, phenometrics calculates Time of Emergence (ToE) metrics, which attempt to identify the exact point at which a species' phenology has exceeded its historical variability and established a new normal. The phenometrics package assumes input data is provided as a data frame, with standardized column names:

\newline

year: Year of the phenological event.
species: Unique species identifier. Can be numeric or character.
event: Time at which the phenological event occurs, typically in Julian day.
env: Environmental conditions (usually temperature) at which the phenological event occurs.

\newline

The basic worker function in the phenometrics package is `emp_tope()`, which calculates the Time of Phenological Emergence (ToPE) for a species using empirical methodology.

```{r example}
# library
library(phenometrics)

# Set seed
set.seed(123)

# Create test dataset
year = seq(1,30,1)
event = round(rnorm(30, 100, 5))- seq(1,30,1)
dataset = data.frame(year, event)

# Calculate empirical time of phenological emergence (ToPE)
emp_tope(dataset)

```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
