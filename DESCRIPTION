Description: This package contains functions to analyze phenological responses to climate change using Time of Emergence (ToE) methodology, which is designed to identify the point at which a species establishes a 'new normal' in terms of its phenology. It also contains functions to summarize the ToE results of many species into community-level indicators, and test for match/mismatch dynamics between species.
